    <h1>Project on console screen</h1>
    <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows
        Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware
        text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key
        combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a
        native full-screen mode is available.
